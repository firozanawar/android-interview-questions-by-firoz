### Q: What is Android ?

Android is an open-source, linux-based operating system that is used in mobiles, tablets, televisions and growing range of devices encompassing everything from wearable computing to in-car entertainment. It launched in 2003 and Andy Rubin is the founder of Android. Android is an open source project (led by Google but it doesn't belong to them) called AOSP (Android Open Source Project) which is equipped with rich components that allows developers to create and run apps that can perform both basic and advanced functions.

In technical words, Android is a stack of software for mobile devices which includes an operating system, middleware and some key applications (Diagram is below). The application executes within its own process and its own instance of Dalvik Virtual Machine. Many instances of Virtual Machines run efficiently by a DVM device. DVM executes Java languages byte code which later transforms into .dex format files. The 'purest' version of Android is often referred to as 'stock Android'. Google acquired Android in 2005. Java and Kotlin language is mainly used to write the android code, even though other languages can be used to write part of App like C/C++. For software development, Android provides Android SDK (Software development kit).
